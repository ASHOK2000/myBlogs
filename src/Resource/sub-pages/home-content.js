                Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students
                define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of
                at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc.
                In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among
                sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is
                defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms
                a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not
                determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For
                instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic
                styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a
                paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one
                main idea. In this handout,
